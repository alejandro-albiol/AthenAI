  summary: Register a new user

    Creates a new user in a gym.

    **Registration Scenarios:**
    - **Superadmin:** Can register tenant admins or users for any gym. Must provide `X-Gym-ID` header (if gym context is not in JWT).
    - **Tenant Admin:** Can register users (not admins) for their own gym. Gym context is extracted from JWT.
    - **Public (Self-Registration):** Can self-register as a user for a specific gym. Must provide `X-Gym-ID` header.

    **Role Restrictions:**
    - Only `superadmin` can register tenant admins.
    - Tenant admins and public users can only register users (not admins).

    **Headers:**
    - `X-Gym-ID`: Required for public/self-registration and for superadmin registration (if gym context is not in JWT). Not used for tenant admin registration.

    **Security:**
    - Uses JWT token for authentication (except for public self-registration).
    - Gym context from JWT claims or `X-Gym-ID` header as described above.

    - bearerAuth: []
