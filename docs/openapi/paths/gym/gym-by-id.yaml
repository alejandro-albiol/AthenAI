    Retrieves a gym by its unique ID with automatic authorization:
    
    **Authorization Logic**:
    - **Platform Admins**: Can access ANY gym
    - **Tenant Users**: Can ONLY access their OWN gym (validated via JWT gym ID)
    
    **Security**: 
    - Gym context extracted from JWT token (no headers required)
    - Access validation based on JWT claims, not request headers
